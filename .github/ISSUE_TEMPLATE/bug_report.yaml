        For example: AutoExporter started, but no telemetry data was sent to the
        configured backend during the export interval.

      placeholder: >-
        E.g. AutoExporter should send all configured signals (traces, metrics,
        logs) to the target backend according to the export interval defined in
        configuration, with no dropped data and no unexpected warnings.

        Markdown supported.
      placeholder: >
        1. Start the service with OpenTelemetry AutoExporter enabled in
        `config.yaml`:
          ```yaml
          exporters:
            otlp:
              endpoint: http://localhost:4317
          ```
        2. Generate telemetry data by performing actions that trigger the instrumented code.

        3. Observe that telemetry data is not visible in the configured backend.
